The effective date of the amendments will appear at the top of the document. Continued use of the Service after that date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Platform before the changes take effect and, if desired, delete your account. For significant revisions that affect Users' rights or obligations, we may request your explicit consent (e.g., by ticking a box) on next sign-in."
